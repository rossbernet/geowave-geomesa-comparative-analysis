\section{Feature Comparison}
\label{sec:featurecompare}

The GeoMesa and GeoWave projects contain many features that overlap, and many that do not.
The Venn diagram shown in Figure \ref{venn} is not a complete list of features,
but indicates the significant overlap of the core features of GeoWave and GeoMesa and some of the distinguishing features that set them apart.

As is illustrated in the diagram, there is a major overlap when it comes to a core feature of the two projects, namely using space filling curves to index geospatial data in Accumulo.
However, there are many features that differentiate the projects from one another.
